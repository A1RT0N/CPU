# CPU Design in Quartus

This repository contains the design and simulation files for a CPU developed in Quartus made by students of the university of SÃ£o Paulo. Below is an overview of each component and simulation included.

## Components

### Control Unit (UC)

The Control Unit (UC) is responsible for directing the operation of the processor. It interprets the instructions from memory and initiates the sequence of microoperations needed to execute them.

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), or ULA, performs all arithmetic and logical operations within the CPU. It can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT operations, which are fundamental for the CPU's functioning.

### Counter Circuit
